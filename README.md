- 👋 Hi, I’m @muscorum
- 👀 I’m interested in Webdevelopment and building infrastructure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, CSS and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything
- 📫 How to reach me: lg.pgr08@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm new in all of this but I'm building myself a great structure and teching myself through curses and the internet.
- I know that this will not make me in 6 months the expert in this but learning constantly will it.
- I'm open to collaborate on anything to start of my career as a webdeveloper.
